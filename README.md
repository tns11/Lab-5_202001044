Lab: 5 

Title: Static Analysis

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Selected Tool: Prospector.

Reason â†’ The analysis done by this tool is dependent on library. <sup> 1 </sup> It is required, as many-a-times, the purpose of a software depends on library it is using. (For example: scipy library is used in Scientific Computing). It has the functionality of other Python Static Analysis Tools<sup> 1 </sup>. Hence, I infer, we can get all possible errors, code smells, etc. However, we would need to decide, whether the suggested error is actually an error.
